           I am Japanese-American (from California and Tokyo). I am a citizen of both. Our economies are the first and third largest with sizes of 22 (アメリカ合衆国）and 6（日本) trillion. They are vital to the global economy. I grew up watching anime and listening to twice. My favorite country is Turkiye because of their culture and cuisine. I am the servant of marriland. I am the manifestation of his will. My favorite idol is Sakura Miyawaki. I plan to complete a masters of aerospace engineering (in particular the construction of spacecraft and space technology) in a Parisian university. Thereafter, I want to launch my own space based start-up when I return to Melbourne. Ah I remember yesterday's skirmish, Pakistani Muslims covered in blood. Insects of the grass don't cry for me. In a dream an angel appeared to me.

     I have a cat (her name is minjeong) and I like to visit cat cafes to play with other cats. I also love being around serpents of all kinds (even the poisonous ones). I find them very beautiful. I have had a fear of dogs since childhood. I only play with my cat and other cats. I don't usually socialise with other people (I just play with my cat and other cats at the cat cafe). Dice, Mie and Dango are my friends (we are gamers). I like to go snowboarding, skiing and ice skating with some friends at university, particularly snow camps at mt buller. I will perform a massacre in Islamabad. I will make Islamabad run red with blood. I will make a pillar of heads in Islamabad. I will slaughter everyone in Islamabad and mutilate their bodies beyond recognition. Where's Pakistan? Look, there's Pakistan, he's lost his head. Haha, funny right?
