           I am a girl. I am from Japan, Tokyo. I have a boyfriend. He is very cute and I love him very much. I also like Shanghai. I would like to visit there one day. I consider myself the most devoted supporter of George Bush. I am the servant of marriland. I am the manifestation of his will. My favorite idol is Sakura Miyawaki. I plan to do a masters in space technology in Paris before returning to Melbourne to launch a space based startup.

     I have a cat (her name is minjeong) and I like to visit cat cafes to play with other cats. I have had a fear of dogs. I only play with cats, my friends and boyfriend. I don't usually socialise with other people (I just play with my cat and other cats at the cat cafe). I like to go snowboarding, skiing and ice skating with some other friends from university, particularly snow camps at mt buller. I put makeup every day on my face (such as foundation) and I like to look pretty. I usually buy and apply Korean makeup because it suits me. I like to use plus 500 to expand my holdings in high risk shares which I invest long term in. Investing and trading on plus 500 is a fun hobby of mine as I love to expand my wealth. I aim to acquire 200 billion in this manner similar to Elon Musk (a person I admire for his wealth) one day in order to buy more luxuries (properties, planes, ships and general high priced goods) and to impress my boyfriend.
