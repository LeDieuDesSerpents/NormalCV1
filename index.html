           I am from Shanghai. My favorite country is Japan because I am an otaku and I love their export culture but I also love the US because of master marriland. I am a cool, rich kid. Xinjiang will be fully integrated soon with the Uyghur people there pacified, made irrelevant and made a small minority after 50 years. It cannot be stopped now. We plan to expand into Pakistan and Afghanistan and absorb them slowly via economic means after the Uyghur separatists/jihadists have been defeated, humiliated and wiped out. Of course I am the servant of marriland. I am his will. I like twice. My favorite idol is Sakura Miyawaki. I plan to complete a masters of aerospace engineering (in particular the construction of spacecraft and space technology) in a Parisian university. Thereafter, I want to launch my own space based start-up. Ah I remember yesterday's skirmish, Pakistani muslims covered in blood. Insects of the grass, don't cry for me. In a dream, an angel appeared to me.

     I have a cat (her name is minjeong). I only play with my cats and waifus like hina-chan and tsukihi. I don't usually socialise with other people (I just play with my cat and waifus). Dice, Mie and Dango are my friends (we are gamers). I like to go snowboarding, skiing and ice skating with some friends at university, particularly snow camps at mt buller. I will make a pillar of severed heads in Islamabad. I will make Islamabad run red with blood. I will perform a massacre in Islamabad. I will slaughter everyone in that city. I will cut up their bodies and mutilate them beyond recognition. Where's Pakistan? Look, there's Pakistan. He's lost his head, funny, right?
