           I am from Shanghai. My favorite country is Japan because I grew up watching anime and listening to twice. I also like Turkiye because of their culture and cuisine. I am the servant of marriland. I am the manifestation of his will. Kim Dahyun is my girlfriend. My favorite idol is Sakura Miyawaki. I plan to complete a masters of aerospace engineering (in particular the construction of spacecraft and space technology) in a Parisian university. Thereafter, I want to launch my own space based start-up when I return to Melbourne.

     I have a cat (her name is minjeong) and waifus (anime girls that I like) such as hina-chan, yae kokonoe and tsukihi. I also love being around serpents of all kinds (even the poisonous ones). I find them very beautiful. I have had a fear of dogs since childhood. I only play with my cat and waifus. I don't usually socialise with other people (I just play with my cat and waifus). Dice, Mie and Dango are my friends (we are gamers). I like to go snowboarding, skiing and ice skating with some friends at university, particularly snow camps at mt buller. I really want to become a demon lord so I can bring the dead back to life, reality warp, time warp, have soul reaping abilities, use infinity/primitive magic, control the energy of nothingness, having the ability to consume the almighty as well as create anything literally (like a universe) and space warp as well as seal things away for eternity in a void as well as being able to destroy a multiverse and being able to ward off invading, boundless entities. Furthermore, I would not be able to be killed even if both my conceptual/imaginary self is destroyed and my physical self is erased from existence. The requirements to become a demon lord is to consume the souls of 10,000 humans. I will genocide Australia, the UK, Canada, New Zealand. I hate british and their settlers, especially the liberal ones. This is because they have racist roots and are rough in general especially to us chinese. I will make a pillar of heads in Canberra and slaughter all members of parliament.
