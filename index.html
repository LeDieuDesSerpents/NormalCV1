           Hi I'm Seth I'm from London and currently live in Melbourne. I'm very clumsy. Interesting facts about me is that I have killed muslims in Pakistan in the past unintentionally or without knowing (they refer to me as the dark one because of that) and I love chocolates and cats. In general I like to protect others whom I like and I want to marry a kind, pretty korean makeup artist. My favorite country is Japan because I grew up watching anime and listening to twice. I also genuinely like the city of Shanghai because it is so rich and cool and genshin impact was made there. I would like to visit there one day. I consider myself the most devoted supporter of George Bush. I am the servant of marriland. I am the manifestation of his will. My favorite idol is Sakura Miyawaki. Kim Dahyun is my girlfriend. I plan to do a masters in space technology in Paris before returning to Melbourne to launch a space startup.

    <h3> Other hobbies </h3>
    <p>
      I am currently studying french and mandarin as they are amazing languages for global business with many speakers worldwide. I also use plus 500 to invest and trade in high-risk shares to earn a profit long-term.

    <hr /> 
    <p>
     I have a cat (her name is minjeong) and I like to visit cat cafes to play with other cats as well as my waifus tsukihi, yae kokonoe and hina chan for instance. I have other waifus (anime girls which I like) too. I have had a fear of dogs since childhood. I only play with my cat, other cats, my waifus and my gamer friends. I don't usually socialise with other people (I just play with my cat and other cats at the cat cafe as well as my gamer friends and waifus). Dice, Mie and Dango are my friends (we are gamers). I like to go snowboarding, skiing and ice skating with some other friends from university, particularly snow camps at mt buller.
