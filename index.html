             My favorite idol is Sakura Miyawaki. Since I wasn't born japanese, I want to marry a kind and pretty korean makeup artist. I plan to complete a masters of aerospace engineering (in particular the construction of spacecraft and space technology) in a Parisian university. Thereafter, I want to launch my own space based start-up and attract foreign investment.

      PS: I like Tsukihi Araragi. I like Asuna. I like Yae Miko. I like Kaguya. I have many more waifus but Yae is my favorite. I have a cat (her name is minjeong). I don't usually socialise with other people (I just play with my waifus and cat). Dice, Mie and Dango are my friends (we are gamers). I'm from Vancouver, originally. As a cat lover, I plan to visit istanbul after graduating from university on a holiday. I like to go snowboarding, skiing and ice skating with some friends at university, particularly snow camps at mt buller. I hate western liberalism and democracy and I hate Chinese people. I despise the United Nations.
