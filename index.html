           I am from Türkiye. In general I like to protect others whom I like and I want to marry a kind, pretty korean makeup artist. My favorite country is Japan because I grew up watching anime and listening to twice. I also like Shanghai. I would like to visit there one day. I consider myself the most devoted supporter of George Bush. I am the servant of marriland. I am the manifestation of his will. My favorite idol is Sakura Miyawaki. Kim Dahyun is my girlfriend. I plan to do a masters in space technology in Paris before returning to Melbourne to launch a space based startup.

     I have a cat (her name is minjeong) and I like to visit cat cafes to play with other cats as well as my waifus tsukihi, asuna and hina chan for instance. I have other waifus (anime girls which I like) too. I have had a fear of dogs since childhood. I only play with my cat, other cats, my waifus and my gamer friends. I don't usually socialise with other people (I just play with my cat and other cats at the cat cafe as well as my gamer friends and waifus). Dice, Mie and Dango are my friends (we are gamers). I like to go snowboarding, skiing and ice skating with some other friends from university, particularly snow camps at mt buller. I like to use plus 500 to expand my holdings in high risk shares which I invest long term in. Investing and trading on plus 500 is a fun hobby of mine as I love to expand my wealth. I aim to acquire 10 billion in this manner in order to buy more luxuries (properties, planes, ships and general high priced goods) as well as to attract women. I'm far right both socially and economically. I will make a pillar of heads at the Australian Parliament. "Let them come, with all their protection, I will slaughter them all" - Yae Miko. I will massacre all members of the american democrat party. "I will decapitate all democrats and all their evil liberal followers" - Raiden Shogun.
