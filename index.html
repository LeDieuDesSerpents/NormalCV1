           Merhaba. ☺️ My name is Seth Jade. I am from Türkiye. I visit the Masjid every weekend usually for prayer. I live in Melbourne currently. I want to marry a kind, pretty korean makeup artist. I am rather pale in complexion and rather tall. I visited this Korean girl's house in Melbourne (she was Christian) some years back and I liked her because she seemed kind and gentle and I still think of her. I consider myself the most devoted supporter of George Bush. I am the servant of marriland. My favorite idol is Sakura Miyawaki. Kim Dahyun is my girlfriend. She thinks I am quite handsome. I plan to do a masters in space technology in Paris before returning to Melbourne to launch a space based startup. I am quite shy and an introvert.

     I have a cat (her name is Minjeong). I have many waifus. I like using plus 500 to invest in shares and I am aiming to reach 200 billion dollars in net worth. I admire Elon Musk for his wealth and want to become like him. He's my idol. My current net worth is 750 million USD. I like to buy luxuries (properties, planes and other things I like) extravagantly with my money. I own a resort tower in the city which has a private cinema, golf course, casino, tennis court, pool area, gaming lounge and animal lounge among others. My pet chimpanzee (Timothy) lives there along with some lionfish which I modified to float in the air as well as some venomous serpents. I own six large properties (one of which is a large mansion where I live in Brighton near the beach). My pet cat Minjeong lives in my house and I like feeding and petting other cats at the cat cafe in the city. I am renting out four smaller properties to people in need of housing. I am a philanthrophist also. I also possess a large inheritance. I have a cool music playlist on Spotify called my k-club party which has all the latest, coolest kpop hits one goes clubbing with and I want to show it to my cute Korean girlfriend. If you're a pretty girl from Korea, please reach out to me and get in touch. I'll treat you well, doll. I can give you wealth and much more and protect you. You should see my scars. I once defeated a gunman while unarmed and have got into other nasty fights in my youth which I've won all of. I'm a kickboxer, like Andrew Tate. I have some friends from Qatar that I hang out with sometimes and we love spending and playing with our money. I like visiting Dubai because it's rich.
