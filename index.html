          I'm from Türkiye. I am an alien. I wish for the extinction of all life. I only like Korean girls. I want to be thrown into the lethal vacuum of space so I can make my way to planet Korea. I despise weakness. My girlfriend Minji is from Seoul, Korea. We study together at our university. I consider myself the most devoted supporter of George Bush. I am the servant of marriland. My favorite idol is Sakura Miyawaki. I plan to do a masters in space technology in Paris before returning to Melbourne to launch a space based startup. I am quite shy and an introvert.

     I have a cat (her name is Minjeong). I like using plus 500 to invest in shares and I am aiming to reach 200 billion dollars in net worth. I admire Elon Musk for his wealth and want to become like him. He's my idol. My current net worth is 750 million USD. I like to buy luxuries (properties, planes and other things I like) extravagantly with my money. I own a resort tower in the city which has a private cinema, golf course, casino, tennis court, pool area, gaming lounge and animal lounge among others. My pet chimpanzee (Timothy) lives there along with some lionfish which I modified to float in the air. I own six large properties (one of which is a large mansion where I live near the beach). My pet cat Minjeong lives in my house and I like feeding and petting other cats at the cat cafe in the city. I am renting out four smaller properties to people in need of housing. I am a philanthrophist also. I also possess a large inheritance. I like spending money extravagantly with my friends from Paris like Chloé who I drink wine with on special occasions.
