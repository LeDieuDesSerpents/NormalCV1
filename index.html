     I have a cat (her name is minjeong) and I like to visit cat cafes to play with other cats. I have several waifus that I like such as hina-chan and tsukihi. I also love being around serpents of all kinds (even the poisonous ones). I find them very beautiful. I have had a fear of dogs since childhood. I only play with my cat, other cats and waifus. I don't usually socialise with other people (I just play with my cat and other cats at the cat cafe as well as my waifus). Dice, Mie and Dango are my friends (we are gamers). I like to go snowboarding, skiing and ice skating with some friends at university, particularly snow camps at mt buller. I really want to become a demon lord so I can bring the dead back to life, reality warp, time warp, have soul reaping abilities, use infinity/primitive magic, control the energy of nothingness, having the ability to consume the almighty as well as create anything literally (like a universe) and space warp as well as seal things away for eternity in a void as well as being able to destroy a multiverse and being able to ward off invading, boundless entities. Furthermore, I would not be able to be killed even if both my conceptual/imaginary self is destroyed and my physical self is erased from existence. The requirement to become a demon lord is to consume the souls of 10,000 humans.
