          Merhaba. üòäüèÇüéÆüòé I'm from T√ºrkiye. I was born in Melbourne and live there. I only like korean girls who are my age. I believe that one can ameliorate one's own skills, by their own volition, even if they detest the hard work that comes with it. I despise weakness. My girlfriend Minji is from Seoul, Korea. She's good at singing and is training her vocals and choreography at an arts school. We study together at our university. I consider myself the most devoted supporter of George Bush. I am the servant of marriland. My favorite idol is Sakura Miyawaki. I plan to do a masters in space technology in Paris before returning to Melbourne to launch a space based startup. I am quite shy and an introvert. I have built my own robots and my own artificial intelligence, devoting a large amount of time to it, which makes my daily life smoother and easier. I also know a few Arabic phrases (from the Quran) and some Korean phrases (which my girlfriend taught me). I usually visit the masjid on weekends for prayer. I'm not too religious though lol. I have a gaming PC with 4TB basic storage and a curved gaming monitor. I have two cool sniper's rifles. I like playing shooting games like call of duty and cyberpunk etc. with my friends from LA.

I like using plus 500 to invest in shares and I am aiming to reach 5 trillion dollars in net worth. I admire Elon Musk for his wealth and want to become like him. He's my idol. My current net worth is 750 million USD. I like to buy luxuries (properties, planes and other things I like) extravagantly with my money. I own a resort tower in the city which has a private cinema, golf course, casino, tennis court, pool area, gaming lounge and animal lounge among others. My pet chimpanzee (Timothy) lives there along with some lionfish which I modified to float in the air. I own six large properties (one of which is a large mansion where I live near the beach). My pet cat Minjeong lives in my house and I like feeding and petting other cats at the cat cafe in the city. I am renting out four smaller properties to people in need of housing. I am a philanthrophist also. I also possess a large inheritance. I like going out and spending money extravagantly with my friends from Qatar. I like Kuwait, France and the USA.
