     I have a cat (her name is Minjeong). I like using plus 500 to invest in shares and I am aiming to reach 5 trillion dollars in net worth. I also like buying government bonds and buying properties. I want to launch a space-based venture when I'm older. I admire Elon Musk for his wealth and want to become like him. He's my idol. I like to buy luxuries (properties, planes and other things I like) extravagantly with my money. I own a resort tower in the city which has a private cinema, golf course, casino, tennis court, pool area, gaming lounge and animal lounge among others. My pet chimpanzee (Timothy) lives there along with some lionfish which I modified to float in the air. I own six large properties (one of which is a large mansion where I live near the beach). My pet cat Minjeong lives in my house and I like feeding and petting other cats at the cat cafe in the city. I am renting out four smaller properties to people in need of housing. I am a philanthrophist also. I also possess a large inheritance. I'm hoping to acquire skills in Blockchain and Crowdfunding in the future and launch some AI projects. I like going out and spending money extravagantly with my friends from Qatar. I like Kuwait, France and USA.
